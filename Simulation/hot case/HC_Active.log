    53843 radks were output, 173587 radks were filtered out
    6 nodes(0%) have bij sum + bij inactive < .9
        This may be ok, but could be reduced by lowering the BIJ Cutoff on the RADK Output Page
    25000 average number of rays per node shot
    7 nodes(0%) have Bij Inactive > .2
        This may be ok, but may be an indication of an incorrect active side
