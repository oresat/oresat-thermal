Restart was successful. No calculations were performed.
    1020 calculation nodes
    6138 radks were output, 17088 radks were filtered out
    0 nodes(0%) have bij sum + bij inactive < .9
    2500 average number of rays per node shot
    355 nodes(34%) have Bij Inactive > .2
        This may be ok, but may be an indication of an incorrect active side
     
    No overlapping surfaces greater than 10.0% found in Exterior

    1364 calculation nodes
    81533 radks were output, 190193 radks were filtered out
    4 nodes(0%) have bij sum + bij inactive < .9
        This may be ok, but could be reduced by lowering the BIJ Cutoff on the RADK Output Page
    5000 average number of rays per node shot
    629 nodes(46%)  have weighted error > 25
        This can be lowered by shooting more rays
     
    Note that overlapping surfaces cause INCORRECT and INCONSISTENT results.
