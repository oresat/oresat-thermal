    1364 calculation nodes
    81807 radks were output, 189991 radks were filtered out
    1 nodes(0%) have bij sum + bij inactive < .9
        This may be ok, but could be reduced by lowering the BIJ Cutoff on the RADK Output Page
    5000 average number of rays per node shot
    629 nodes(46%)  have weighted error > 25
        This can be lowered by shooting more rays
     
    Note that overlapping surfaces cause INCORRECT and INCONSISTENT results.
