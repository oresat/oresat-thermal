C  LOADQ is SINDA subroutine that simplifies the SINDA output
C  and speeds up SINDA preprocessing and compile time.
C  For transient routines, LOADQ interpolates at the current time
C  If there is 1 point in the time array, those values always used
C  If the orbit time starts at 0., the intepolation is cyclic.
C     Negative times will be adjusted via period before interpolation is done.
C  If the orbit time starts at != 0., strict time intepolation is done.
C     If time < first time, values are at the first time.
C     If time > last time, values are at the last time.
C  For steady state solutions, DTIMES controls whether the calculation
C  is the TIME averaged load (DTIMES=0.) or if interpolation is used.
C  LOADQ interpolates on the SINDA variable TIMEM.
C  The data is all stored in the array file, and the node
C  submodels and numbers are stored in CARRAY type data.
C  The arguments to LOADQ are:
C     Submodel name that contains the carray data
C     First carray number
C     Total number of carrays used
C     Storage array internally used for relative node numbers
C     Area array if data output as flux, set to zero if total absorbed
C     Array of steady state values
C     Time array
C     Scale array where heating rates can be scaled
